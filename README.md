# CashGenius

CashGenius helps the visually impaired to identify banknotes, saving time, money and effort for them. It also protects them from fraud.
CashGenius solves a persistent problem for the blind - fraud in financial transactions. The blind are more prone to being cheated by shopkeepers as they can be given the wrong amount for goods they buy. This means they might get less value for their money. Also we cannot neglect the possibility of human error. CashGenius solves this effectively by telling the exact amount of cash received in audio and on top of that, gives the total sum received - saving a lot of time for the blind.
